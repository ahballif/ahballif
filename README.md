## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Addison Ballif. I am currently a physics major at Brigham Young University - Idaho with an emphasis in mathematics. 

I have been blessed with many opportunities to work on several different projects that have taught me a variety of skills. My github features much of the work I have done on these projects.
